###Streamer Rules
1. Link directly to the stream.
2. Do not post links to websites with a list of different streams.
3. DO NOT post fake replies to your stream links. You WILL be banned without notice and your domain will be blacklisted.
4. Always specify if your stream is HD or SD.
5. Always specify the language of the stream.
6. Always specify if your stream is mobile compatible.
7. Puffin browser DOES NOT count as mobile compatibility.
8. Only use bold to highlight HD. Anything else is not allowed.
9. We do not allow duplicate streams, meaning even if you have permission to embed someone else's stream, if the original stream is already available in the Match Thread, your post will be removed.

11. Please [CLICK HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccerstreams/comments/4zy419/new_rule_new_format_for_posting_acestreamsopcast/) to see how to post AceStream/Sopcast links.
12. You are not allowed to create duplicate accounts. Anyone found to have created duplicate accounts will be immediately banned and their domain will be blacklisted. We have a zero tolerance policy with this rule.
13. Poaching streams is a bannable offense. If you are caught poaching streams you may be banned without warning.
Advertising private Twitter accounts or Subreddits in your comments or streams is not allowed.
14. If your website contains NSFW ads, this must be indicated in your comment.
16. You must list the number of ad overlays on your stream, i.e. list the number of ads that cover the player on your website. [CLICK HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccerstreams/comments/5m96sq/streamers_please_read_new_rules_regarding_ads/) for format on how to post this.
17. The use of tables is not allowed.
18. Bullet points in comments are not allowed.
19. Abusing any members or other streamers is also a bannable offence.
 
###Member Rules
 
1. Upcoming match threads are shown in the table in the sidebar. If you do not find the match you are looking for, please create one 30 minutes before kick-off, and not any sooner.
1. As considerate members, please upvote the links you like to help out fellow fans.
1. Please use the 'report' feature to notify the moderators about any improper streams which may require correction(s).
1. Please reserve the use of the 'spam' feature to only report spam. Please do not report legitimate posts or streams.
1. Please do not ask for any links to be privately messaged.
1. Please do not post requesting VLC streams or Acestream links in match threads unless you are unable to find one at least 5 minutes before kick-off time.
1. We delete threads after matches end, so don't be alarmed if you don't see any match threads on the front page. There is a table in the sidebar outlining the upcoming games for the day.
 
###Match Thread Rules
 
1. Match threads will be posted at least 45 minutes before kick-off of each game.
1. If you don't see a match that you are looking for, please create a match thread.
1. Request tags are not allowed.
1. Please create match threads for the matches that you'd like to watch if the bot does not create one at least 15 minutes before kick-off.
1. All match threads should be labeled as follows: [KICK-OFF TIME IN GMT] Team 1 vs Team 2.
1. All match threads must contain [the name of the competition in the body of the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccerstreams/comments/4t5gkk/new_rule_match_thread_creators_must_include_the/).
1. Match threads will be taken down after the game is over to keep the sub clutter-free.
